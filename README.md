## 📌 Project Overview
The **Java Graphic Manipulation App** is an advanced graphical editing tool that allows users to create, transform, and manipulate graphical objects such as circles, rectangles, and images. Leveraging **Software Engineering Design Patterns**, this project optimizes code efficiency, reduces execution time, and ensures maintainability and scalability.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Create** graphical objects (circles, rectangles, and images) 📐🖼️  
✅ **Scale** objects dynamically to desired dimensions 📏  
✅ **Move** objects across the canvas with precision 🔄  
✅ **Apply transformations** using powerful design patterns 🚀  
✅ **Optimized execution** with structured and reusable code 🏎️  

## 🏗️ Applied Design Patterns

This project integrates multiple **Software Engineering Design Patterns** to ensure clean architecture and optimized performance:

- **🔄 Command Pattern**: Enables undo/redo functionality, encapsulating actions as commands.
- **🎭 Facade Pattern**: Simplifies interactions by providing a unified API for graphical operations.
- **👀 Observer Pattern**: Ensures real-time updates when objects are modified.
- **📜 Interpreter Pattern**: Implements a flexible syntax for graphical command execution.

By applying these patterns, the project achieves **better modularity, code reusability, and improved execution efficiency**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 11+ ☕
- Maven/Gradle (optional for dependency management) 📦

### 📥 Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Andrea-1704/Design_pattern_project.git
 cd java-graphic-manipulation
```


## 🛠️ Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
- Create a new graphical object
- Resize, move, and manipulate objects
- Perform batch transformations
